A basic CRUD operation on a mysql database using AWS RDS(Relational Database Service) instance with Spring boot. <br>
I didn't add the application.properties file for security reasons. <br>
An extra html file was added just to test the API endpoint on browser but I removed it later from my controller code , so the file could be seen in static folder. <br>
Happy Coding :)
