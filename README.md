A basic CRUD operation on a mysql database using AWS RDS(Relational Database Service) instance with Spring boot.
I didn't add the application.properties file for security reasons.
An extra html was added just to test the API endpoint on browser but I removed it later from my controller code , so the file could be seen in static folder.
Happy Coding :)
